Just run "BMM()" . That's all! Enjoy!
Result: It only takes about 10 iterations for the algorithm to converge (the resulting images doesn't change anymore). Also, when I used 600 images on the training set, I got about 75% accuracy, but when I used all of the images from 2-4 (17931 in total), the results were 90% accuracy (not bad for my first project).
