This is an attemp to recreate the results in the book Pattern recognition and machine learning (Bishop) . Because the book is full of mathemathical equations, beginners (including me) may feel scared toward it. However I think we can recreate many figures in the books and therefore demonstrate a deeper understanding of the subject.
