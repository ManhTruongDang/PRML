This is an attemp to recreate the results in the book Pattern recognition and machine learning (Bishop) . Because the book is full of mathemathical equations, beginners (including me) may feel overwhelmed and intimadated. However I think we can gain practical knowledge out of this book by recreating the figures and therefore demonstrate a deeper understanding of the subject. Also because it's cool !
